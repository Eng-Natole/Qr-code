What I learned
This project helped me practice and enhance my skills in creating simple but effective layouts using Flexbox and CSS. I also gained experience working with semantic HTML5, ensuring the content is both accessible and easy to read. One area I focused on was optimizing the layout for mobile devices to ensure a smooth, responsive design.

Continued development
In future projects, I aim to refine my understanding of Flexbox and CSS Grid for building even more complex layouts. I also plan to explore how to further enhance accessibility in my projects by focusing on color contrast and keyboard navigation.
